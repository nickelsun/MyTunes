This project is based on a predefined markup and styling. 
It is a simple example that demonstrates <br>
embedding <b>video</b> and <audio> elements in a webpage.

The fisrt two tabs, 'Video' and 'Music', 
implement a video player and a music player accordingly,
based on static <video> and <audio> tags.
Both players can play a single media file.
The third tab 'Radio' contains a list of predefined
radio stations. Having been selected by a user,
a desired radio is played via Audio object,
created in javascript.
