This project is based on a predefined markup and styling. <br>
It is a simple example that demonstrates <br>
embedding <b>video</b> and <b>audio</b> elements in a webpage. <br>

The fisrt two tabs, 'Video' and 'Music', <br>
implement a video player and a music player accordingly, <br>
based on static <video> and <audio> tags. <br>
Both players can play a single media file. <br>
The third tab 'Radio' contains a list of predefined <br>
radio stations. Having been selected by a user, <br>
a desired radio is played via Audio object, <br>
created in javascript. <br>
